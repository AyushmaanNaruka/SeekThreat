# Decision log

Every decision that changes the plan gets logged here. Same day, while the reasoning is fresh.

**Log a decision when it:**
- diverges from `docs/00-scope.md`
- adds or drops a dependency, tool, or scanner
- changes scope — in or out
- picks between two real options (database, library, approach)
- reverses something we decided earlier

**Don't log:** routine implementation choices, variable names, styling.

**Why this matters:** in month six we write the final report and defend this in a viva. "Why did you choose Neo4j?" and "why did the scope change in October?" are questions with real answers, and this is where we keep them. Reconstructing it from memory in January does not work.

### D-009 — Pydantic v2 replaces dataclasses in packages/schema
**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Decided by:** Full team
**Type:** Divergence
**Status:** Active

**Decision**
Convert `packages/schema` from plain `@dataclass` to Pydantic v2 `BaseModel`.

**Why**
`CLAUDE.md` already requires "Pydantic models for anything crossing a boundary," and the
committed code does not do this — the divergence exists today and this resolves it in favour
of the rule. Three concrete gains: validation at every boundary, deterministic serialization
that the graph purity test depends on, and FastAPI request/response models for free.

**Impact on plan**
Phase 0 work, before any feature code depends on the current shapes. Doing it later means
touching every module that imports schema.

**Cost if we're wrong**
Very low. Pydantic v2 models are close enough to dataclasses that reverting is mechanical, and
the conversion happens while almost nothing imports them.

### D-008 — ERS weights hand-tuned and documented, not learned
**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Decided by:** Full team
**Type:** Tool choice
**Status:** Active

**Decision**
Exposure Risk Score component weights are chosen by hand, documented with reasoning, and
published with a sensitivity analysis. KEV membership is used to *validate* the resulting
ranking, not as a training target.

**Why**
Learning weights requires labelled data telling us which exposures actually mattered, and we
do not have it. A learned number we cannot justify is worse in a viva than a stated weighting
we can defend line by line. Sensitivity analysis shows which weights actually change the
ranking, which is a more honest result than a fitted model on 200 hosts.

Reinforces the standing constraint from `services/enrichment/README.md`: never multiply EPSS
by CVSS. Components combine additively with stated weights, each rendering its own explanation
through `ScoreComponent`.

**Impact on plan**
Removes a modelling task from the enrichment layer. The ML effort concentrates on the gap-
filler classifier instead, where a published BRON baseline exists to beat.

**Cost if we're wrong**
Low. If hand-tuned weights rank badly and we later obtain labels, the `ScoreComponent`
structure already separates weights from components, so fitting them is a contained change.

### D-007 — Row-level engagement scoping, not schema-per-tenant
**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Decided by:** Full team
**Type:** Tool choice
**Status:** Active

**Decision**
Every row carries an `engagement_id`. No schema-per-tenant, no row-level security policies.

**Why**
Deliberate YAGNI. This project has no tenants and will not acquire any before January.
Schema-per-tenant buys isolation we do not need and costs migration complexity in every month
we do have.

**Impact on plan**
None. Simplifies the data layer.

**Cost if we're wrong**
Low within this project's life. If real multi-tenancy is ever needed, `engagement_id` is
already the discriminator a stronger isolation model would key on.

### D-006 — Ollama for model serving, behind a ModelClient interface
**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Decided by:** Full team
**Type:** Tool choice
**Status:** Active

**Decision**
Serve Foundation-Sec-8B-Reasoning through Ollama in every environment. Access it only through
a `ModelClient` interface in `services/assistant`.

**Why**
The architecture doc previously assumed "Ollama for dev, vLLM for demo," but vLLM assumes
server-class hardware we do not have — development and the demo both happen on 16 GB laptops.
Running one serving path everywhere also removes a class of demo-day surprise.

The interface means a future vLLM or hosted endpoint is a swap, not a rewrite.

**Impact on plan**
Removes vLLM from the stack. Model runs quantized, in the `model` compose profile, never
alongside the lab.

**Cost if we're wrong**
Low. The interface is the insurance. If Ollama throughput proves inadequate for the demo,
swapping the implementation is a contained change.

### D-005 — pgvector, not Qdrant
**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Decided by:** Full team
**Type:** Tool choice
**Status:** Active

**Decision**
Vector storage and retrieval for the assistant use pgvector inside our existing Postgres.

**Why**
Postgres is already in the stack. Qdrant is a second service, a second backup story, and
another ~300 MB on a memory budget that is already oversubscribed. At our corpus size —
findings and observations from a few hundred hosts — pgvector's performance is not a
constraint, and keeping retrieval next to the facts makes citation joins trivial.

**Impact on plan**
One fewer service in `infra/docker-compose.yml`.

**Cost if we're wrong**
Low. Retrieval sits behind an interface in `services/assistant/retrieval.py`; the corpus is
small enough to re-index into a different store in an afternoon.

### D-004 — Python rules-as-data, not Datalog
**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Decided by:** Full team
**Type:** Tool choice
**Status:** Active

**Decision**
Attack path rules are declared as YAML in `services/graph/rules/` and evaluated by a small
deterministic Python engine. No Datalog, no Prolog, no XSB.

**Why**
MulVAL's Datalog semantics are worth studying and we will reimplement the ideas, but adopting
Datalog itself means a second language, an XSB dependency, and debugging that is genuinely
hard when a path comes out wrong under time pressure. With one strong developer and two still
building Python fluency, that cost lands in the wrong place.

Rules-as-data still satisfies the standing requirement in `services/graph/README.md` that
rules be data rather than code, so they can be cited in the report and extended without
touching the engine. Each rule carries a `citation` field.

**Impact on plan**
No timeline change. Concentrates November's difficulty in one engine module that a single
developer can own.

**Cost if we're wrong**
Medium. If YAML rules prove too weak to express the semantics we need, we would rewrite the
evaluator — but the rules themselves, being data, largely survive that rewrite.

### D-003 — Postgres facts plus in-memory NetworkX; Neo4j as a read-only projection
**Date:** 2026-09-05
**Decided by:** Full team
**Type:** Tool choice
**Status:** Active

**Decision**
Postgres holds an append-only store of immutable, provenance-tagged observations. The attack
graph is rebuilt in memory with NetworkX from those facts on demand and is never a source of
truth. Neo4j is committed as a **read-only projection** for visualization, rebuilt from facts,
disposable at any time, landing with the graph builder in November behind a `viz` profile.

**Why**
Four reasons, in order of weight.

Determinism becomes a structural property rather than a promise: if the graph is a pure
function of facts, the same observations produce byte-identical paths, and that is a test we
run in CI. A mutable graph database accumulates state and drifts, so we would be asserting
determinism on a substrate that does not enforce it.

Remediation simulation — mark a vulnerability fixed, recompute, show which paths disappear —
is our best demo moment, and it is natural over an in-memory rebuild and awkward over a
persistent store. Chokepoint analysis has the same shape. Both are brute-force loops that are
free when a rebuild costs milliseconds.

The rules engine must be Python regardless, because every edge carries `rule_name` and
`evidence` attached at creation. A graph database would only store and re-query what Python
already computed, making it a persistence choice rather than a reasoning one.

Scale does not justify it. At 50–200 hosts the graph is a few thousand nodes, and the BRON
traversal (CVE→CWE→CAPEC→ATT&CK) is fixed-depth — three joins, not graph traversal. Neo4j's
advantages do not activate at this size, but its ~1.5–2.5 GB does.

We considered making Neo4j the graph of record and rejected it: path rules would become
Cypher, which is code rather than data, weakening the claim that our rules are citable.

**Impact on plan**
Neo4j moves from Month 1 infrastructure to a November deliverable alongside the graph builder,
and is second on the cut list. Frees memory during development and removes a second query
language from the two months where the team is least experienced.

**Cost if we're wrong**
Low to medium. If the in-memory graph outgrows a laptop — which would require a scale far
beyond the scoped 50–200 hosts — the graph builder writes through a `GraphSink` interface, so
a persistent backend is an added implementation rather than a rewrite.

### D-002 — Adopt BRON as the knowledge graph substrate
**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Decided by:** Full team
**Type:** Divergence
**Status:** Active

**Decision**
Use MIT ALFA group's BRON as our static CVE→CWE→CAPEC→ATT&CK graph rather than building the mapping pipeline ourselves. Ingest its output as data; do not vendor its code.

**Why**
The original scope had us constructing this mapping in month three. BRON already links ATT&CK, CAPEC, CWE, CVE, Engage, D3FEND, CAR and ATLAS with bidirectional edges. Published work using it also documents baseline coverage figures — 62% CVE→CWE, 35% CWE→CAPEC, 16% CAPEC→ATT&CK before completion, 72/85/66 after. That gives our ML gap-filler classifier a measurable baseline to beat instead of an unanchored number.

**Impact on plan**
Frees roughly three weeks in month three. Reallocated to remediation simulation (see D-003 when logged). Our ML classifier is now framed as an improvement over a published baseline rather than a standalone component.

**Cost if we're wrong**
Low. If BRON's data proves unusable we fall back to building the mapping from raw MITRE sources, losing the three weeks we saved. Licence must be verified before ingestion.

### D-001 — Build our own enrichment fusion instead of using Vulnerability-Lookup
**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Decided by:** Full team
**Type:** Scope decision
**Status:** Active

**Decision**
Run CIRCL's Vulnerability-Lookup as a comparator and baseline only. Our multi-source fusion logic — provenance tagging, confidence scoring, fallback chains, Exposure Risk Score — stays entirely ours.

**Why**
Vulnerability-Lookup does much of what our Layer 2 does, including a RoBERTa ATT&CK technique classifier close to our planned gap-filler. Adopting it would save weeks and simultaneously remove both of our differentiators. The honest answer to "what did you build?" would become "a UI and some scanner adapters."

It is also AGPL-3.0, so copying any of its code would make our whole project AGPL — closing off a closed deployment or any commercial path later.

**Impact on plan**
No change to scope. Confirms the fusion engine as core original work. Their classifier becomes a published baseline we measure against.

**Cost if we're wrong**
Low. If our fusion underperforms we can still fall back to running theirs as a service, which costs no licence contamination.
